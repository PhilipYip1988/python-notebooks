## Viewing Notebook Files

### GitHub

These markdown and notebook files are stored on GitHub. 

When a markdown file is opened in GitHub, the markdown preview should show. Unfortunately GitHub is case sensitive to the file extension of an image file .png vs .PNG and images may not render correctly unless the correct file extension is used. On slow connections with lots of images, the browser may time out and not render the image correctly.

These notebooks often look up docstrings for a reference and use the scrolling output to take the emphasis away from the docstring. Unfortunately when the cell output is set to scrolling this is ignored by GitHub. 

## Downloading and Running Notebook Files

It is recommended to select Code and then Download Zip:

Note you may not see the Download button if viewing a subfolder and need to go on the root page. [Python Notebooks Root](https://github.com/PhilipYip1988/python-notebooks)

### JupyterLab

The notebook files will render best in JupyterLab. It is recommended to clear all outputs
