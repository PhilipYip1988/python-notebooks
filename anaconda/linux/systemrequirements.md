# System Requirements

The lightweight IDEs such as IDLE and Thonny require similar system resources to a text editor. Some of the more feature rich IDEs such as Spyder and PyCharm require more system resources. Poor performance may be encountered below the following system requirements:

* Linux Kernel 5.15 (>6.2 recommended)
* 8th Generation i5 Processor or AMD Ryzen 5 or newer
* UEFI BIOS (SMBIOS 3.0+) with Secure Boot
* 8 GB RAM 
* 256 GB SSD
* Graphics Card with a WDDM 2.0 Display Driver
* TPM 2.0
