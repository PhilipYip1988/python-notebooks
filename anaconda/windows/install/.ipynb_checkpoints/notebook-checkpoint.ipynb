    "# Install\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide looks at installing Anaconda 2024-02.1 on Windows 11.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Removing Previous Installations\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda should be installed on a Linux PC that has no previous Python installations outwith the system Python. The system Python is preinstalled as part of the Linux Operating system and should be considered as part of the Operating System and not modified by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an old Anaconda Installation or an Anaconda based installation such as Miniconda or is present these should be removed by deleting their perspective folders. Note that deletion of these folders leaves behind a large number of configuration files and the presence of these files often results in problematic settings persisting after a reinstall. For best results it is recommended to delete all these configuration files. For more details see [Uninstallation Instructions](../uninstall/readme.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anaconda vs Miniconda \n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda is a Python distribution that has a base Python environment that is designed to be used *as is*. The base Python environment has the conda package manager that can be used to create a separate Python environment (subinstallation of Python) for a custom configuration of packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Miniconda is a bootstrap version of Anaconda, that only contains the conda package manager and can likewise be used to create Python environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda should be preferenced when, the user required a preconfigured (base) Python environment to be used *as is*. When the user plans to only create custom Python environments, Miniconda should be preferenced.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anaconda Python Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The Anaconda Python distribution comes with its own base Python environment that contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python\n",
    "* Python Standard Libraries\n",
    "* The conda Package Manager\n",
    "* The Anaconda Navigator\n",
    "* Third Party Libraries:\n",
    "  * numpy\n",
    "  * pandas\n",
    "  * matplotlib\n",
    "  * seaborn\n",
    "  * plotly\n",
    "  * pillow\n",
    "  * scikit-learn\n",
    "  * scikit-image\n",
    "  * ‚Åù\n",
    "* Third-party IDEs:\n",
    "  * Spyder\n",
    "  * Jupyter\n",
    "    * JupyterLab\n",
    "    * Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "    * Jupyter QTConsole\n",
    "    * Jupyter Console\n",
    "* Third-party formatters:\n",
    "  * autopep8\n",
    "  * isort\n",
    "  * black\n",
    "\n",
    "### Miniconda\n",
    "\n",
    "Miniconda is a stripped down version of Anaconda containing only:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python\n",
    "* Python Standard Libraries\n",
    "* The conda Package Manager\n",
    "\n",
    "## conda\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda and Miniconda have the conda package manager which should be used in preference to the native Python package manager pip. \n",
    "\n",
    "* conda\n",
    "* ~~pip~~\n",
    "\n",
    "pip is strictly a package manager for Python packages. However many datascience projects under the hood, use code that is written in C++ for performance gains. The conda package manager manages both the Python and non-Python dependencies. The conda package manager has also been written in C++ for increased performance and reliability. This was separately developed as mamba and the conda package manager uses the libmamba (C++) solver by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conda package manager uses two channels:\n",
    "\n",
    "* conda-forge\n",
    "* anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "The first channel community forge is the community channel and has the largest number of packages available.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second channel is the channel maintained by Anaconda Inc. Anaconda Inc test packages for compatibility with the Anaconda Python Distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a consequence the latest version of a package available on the anaconda channel may be dated with respect to the package on the conda-forge channel as it takes Anaconda Inc some time to test packages. Moreover Anaconda Inc only test the most commonly used datascience libraries and therefore more niche packages will only be available on conda-forge.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Anaconda base environment the following commands should never be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ~~pip install package~~\n",
    "* ~~conda install conda-forge::package~~\n",
    "* ~~conda install -c conda-forge package~~\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because use of multiple package managers and use of multiple channels will make the Anaconda base Python environment unstable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only packages available from the anaconda channel should be installed in base:\n",
    "\n",
    "* conda install anaconda::package\n",
    "* conda install -c anaconda package\n",
    "\n",
    "The base Python environment is normally used *as is* and instead a custom Python environment is used to install a subinstallation of Python with custom packages, usually from the conda-forge community channel. More details about channels will be given later.\n",
    "\n",
