    "In the previous notebook the immutable tuple was examined which was a collection of instance names which can be conceptualised as a collection of labels that each act as a reference to a Python object. The tuple was seen to be utilise the immutable Collection design pattern and therefore had consistent behaviour to the string class and bytes class which are also immutable Collections.\n",
